/**
 * Bootstrapper behind `curl -fsSL quirq.ai/install | sh`.
 *
 * It fetches xo-space's install.sh and runs it, and does nothing else. The
 * installer owns the checkout, the Python environment, the configuration and
 * the server; duplicating any of that here would put the same logic on two
 * release cycles, where the copy served by this site can silently fall behind
 * the copy in the repository.
 *
 * The one-liner is advertised with `| sh`, so this script stays POSIX. The
 * installer needs Bash — it uses BASH_SOURCE and `set -o pipefail` — so it is
 * handed to `bash` explicitly rather than inherited into `sh`.
