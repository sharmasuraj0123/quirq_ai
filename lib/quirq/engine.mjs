 * Intelligence" (draft v3), served at /whitepaper/pdf.
 *
 * Written as .mjs rather than .ts on purpose: the same file has to run under

 * execute .ts) AND be imported by the Next app. Types live in engine.d.ts.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the filesystem, the network, or a clock, so it behaves
 * identically in the browser and in the CLI. Node-only concerns (snapshotting
 * real directories) live in snapshot.mjs, which the web app never imports.
