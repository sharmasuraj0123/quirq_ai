/**
 * A simulated workspace, for minting your first quirq in a browser tab.
 *
 * THE LINE BETWEEN REAL AND STAGED, because the whole product claim rests on
 * it and a demo that blurs it is worse than no demo:
 *
 *   STAGED  the files, and the "agent" that edits them. There is no repo and
 *           no model. `runAgent` is a scripted editor with two behaviours.
 *   REAL    everything downstream. Files are hashed with SHA-256 via Web
 *           Crypto, the definition of done is evaluated against the captured
 *           after-state, and scoring, minting and the hash chain are the same
 *           engine.mjs and ledger.mjs the CLI runs.
 *
 * So the arithmetic and the verification are not simulated: only the world
 * they are pointed at is. Keep that split, and keep saying so on the page.
 *
 * Isomorphic and dependency-free. The node CLI has its own filesystem
 * equivalent in snapshot.mjs; this is the in-memory twin.
