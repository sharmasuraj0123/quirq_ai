/**
 * Phases 3 and 4 of the list-to-tree migration: choreography as a tree.
 *
 * The tree is an AUTHORING structure, never a runtime one. A resolver runs
 * when the page mounts or the context changes (resize), filters branches by
 * their `when` predicates, flattens depth-first to leaves, and merges each
 * leaf's partial keyframe over its ancestors so every leaf comes out FULL.
 * The per-frame path only ever sees the resolved flat track; it never walks
 * the tree.
 *
 * Cascade rule: a node's keyframe is spread over the merge of everything
 * above it. The root MUST be full (it is the base the shot falls back to);
 * leaves override only what differs. Beat 4 demonstrates it: its `x` is
 * inherited from the root rather than restated.
