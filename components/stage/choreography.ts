/**
 * The resolved keyframe track and its sampler.
 *
 * Since the list-to-tree migration, the track is no longer authored here: it
 * is resolved from the CHOREOGRAPHY tree in choreo-tree.ts (filter branches,
 * flatten to leaves, cascade partial keyframes). This module owns the
 * resolved state and the two per-frame functions, which stay allocation-free.
 *
 * The glass form is a single object that never unmounts; it is transformed
 * and re-tuned as the page scrolls, so the whole site reads as one continuous
 * shot rather than separate scenes. The optical values carry the argument:
 * colour is *value*.
