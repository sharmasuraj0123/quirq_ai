/**
 * Builds a journey document out of real git history.
 *
 * This is the general case of interactive reading. A research note becomes a
 * journey because a deriver reads its chapters; a repository becomes a journey
 * because this script reads its commits. Neither the engine nor the renderer
 * knows the difference: both produce the same JourneyDefinition, with the same
 * beats and the same figure specs, and both are validated the same way.
 *
 * The mapping is the one from the gitstory plan: one mark per commit, time
 * across, subsystem up the lanes, churn as the mark's weight, the subject's
 * scope prefix as its group. Nothing is aggregated away; every commit in range
 * is a mark you can point at, and its short hash rides in the mark's label.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-git-journey.mjs [--limit=300] [--path=.] [--slug=git-history]
 *
 * Writes .quirq/journeys/<slug>.json, which the journeys API then serves and
 * the loader walks like any other document.
