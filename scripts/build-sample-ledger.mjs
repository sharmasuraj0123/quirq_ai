/**
 * Builds the sample ledger the dashboard reads.
 *
 * Every record is produced the same way the CLI produces one: files are
 * really written to a scratch workspace, really hashed before and after, and
 * the definition of done is really evaluated against the after-state. No
 * number in the output is typed by hand.
 *
 * What IS staged: the agent is a script rather than a model, and the
 * timestamps are laid out across a month so the dashboard has a trend to
 * draw. That is exactly the whitepaper's "mock mode" — it validates the
 * machinery, and it cannot validate claims about real agents. The dashboard
 * says so on the page; do not quietly drop that label.
